## Quantum Algorithms

I have implemented the following quantum algorithms using two popular quantum programming languages, PyQuil and Qiskit.

* Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm (Coming Soon)
* Bernstein–Vazirani Algorithm (Coming Soon)
* Grover's Algorithm
* Simon's Algorithm (Coming Soon)

They algorithms can be run using quantum similators provided with the quantum programming libraries. The number of possible qubits depends on the algorithm being run the user CPU but will typically not exceed 10 qubits.
