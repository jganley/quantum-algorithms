# Quantum Algorithms

I have implemented the following quantum algorithms using two popular quantum programming languages, PyQuil and Qiskit.

* Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm (Coming Soon)
* Bernstein–Vazirani Algorithm (Coming Soon)
* Grover's Algorithm
* Simon's Algorithm (Coming Soon)

The algorithms can be run using quantum simulators provided by the quantum programming libraries. The number of possible qubits depends on the algorithm being run and the user's CPU but will typically not exceed 10 qubits.
